 * this component is meant to render "pages" which consists of individual Section component
 * it is not rendering in pages yet because there are no use cases yet
 * so this is just a placeholder for now

 * this component renders the sections object and cannot be defined via `uiType`
 * i.e. it is used internally only
 *
 * TODO:
 * - render pages properly
 * - handle validation and errors in each section before navigating away
