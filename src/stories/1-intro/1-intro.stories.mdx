# Web Frontend Engine

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@lifesg/web-frontend-engine.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lifesg/web-frontend-engine)

A form building library to come up with forms with relative ease.

-   UI components based on @lifesg/react-design-system
-   Form generation via JSON schema

### Purpose

The intention of frontend engine is to take out the heavy lifting of form development and offer a collection of common fields so engineers can develop forms quickly. The form will be defined through a JSON schema so non-engineers can customise the form as well.

### Design system

Frontend Engine is developed based on [@lifesg/react-design-system](https://bitbucket.ship.gov.sg/projects/PUSH/repos/@lifesg/react-design-system/browse). It relies on the design system for colours, theming, grid system and components. For more details on customising / usage / guidelines, please refer to its [storybook](https://www.dev.lifesg.io/storybook/lifesg/index.html?path=/story/introduction-getting-started--page).

### React Form Hook and Yup

Under the hood, the Frontend Engine relies on [React Form Hook](https://react-hook-form.com/) as the form library. React Form Hook in turn relies on [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to come up with the validation rules. If you are intending to work with this library, it will be beneficial to be familiar with the libraries and their concepts.

## Installation

`npm i @lifesg/web-frontend-engine`

## Usage

```tsx
import { FrontendEngine } from "@lifesg/web-frontend-engine";

const App = () => {
	return (
		<FrontendEngine
			data={{
				sections: {
					mySection: {
						uiType: "section",
						children: {
							myField: {
								uiType: "text-field",
								label: "My field",
							},
							submit: {
								uiType: "submit",
								label: "Submit",
							},
						},
					},
				},
			}}
		/>
	);
};

export default App;
```
